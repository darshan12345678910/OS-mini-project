# Memory allocation using First-fit, Best-fit and Worst-fit.
Contiguous memory allocation is an essential technique used in modern operating systems to allocate memory to processes. First Fit, Best Fit, and Worst Fit are popular algorithms used for contiguous memory allocation. Each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages, but all are designed to optimize memory allocation and reduce fragmentation. With these techniques, operating systems can efficiently manage memory, making them a critical component of computer science and software engineering.
